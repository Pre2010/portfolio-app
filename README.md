    But with attribution. While the project is open source, plagiarism is a no no.

    Please give me credit for the hard work that I put into the site and all I ask is that you leave the footer text and link pointing to my GitHub
    alone which gives me credit for designing and developing the site.

    Other than that, have at it!
